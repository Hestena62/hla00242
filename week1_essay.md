Class: DIMENSIONS OF SELF AND SOCIETY 

 

Lawrence Hill's story, "So, What are You, Anyway?", serves as a poignant allegory for the experiences of a mixed-race child. The story stood out to me from what I normally read, but my prior knowledge of the time and context of Lawrence Hill's childhood made it less jarring. I believe Hill's purpose was to convey a personal experience, either of his own or that of someone close to him, using the story to illustrate what daily life was like for him as a child. This essay will argue that using character interactions and a realistic setting, Hill effectively explores how racial prejudice shapes a person's identity and sense of self. Furthermore, by understanding Hill's background as the son of civil rights activists, we can see how his real-life experiences with race and identity directly influence his writing. 

The story's power lies in its ability to evoke a strong personal reaction, even before the author's full intent becomes clear. The narrative ultimately reveals itself to be about an event from a long time ago, involving "cruel people with closed minds filled with hatred". This theme resonates deeply with me because I was raised not to focus on a person's race or skin color, but rather to see them for who they are using their character and actions. 

My mother taught me this lesson through her own actions. She once told me a story about my younger brother, who has a dark-skinned friend in grade school. One day, my brother saw a boy riding his bike and thought it was his friend, but it wasn't. My mom was about to say it wasn't him because the boy on the bike was white, but she stopped herself. Instead, she simply said, "I don't think that is your friend". When my brother asked why, she replied, "I just don't think he is". This interaction demonstrates her commitment to raising us to see a person for who they are, not their skin color. This personal anecdote, like the story's theme, reinforces the idea that racism and hatred are learned behaviors, not innate qualities. As Dr. Nina J. stated in a video I watched, "We aren't one race, we are one people on this earth". 

Lawrence Hill's purpose is to examine how racial prejudice shapes a person's identity and sense of self. This is powerfully conveyed through specific character interactions, particularly with the stewardess. When a woman in front of Carole stands up and asks, "Would you like to come and sit with me, little girl?" and the stewardess later says, "How would you like to come and sit with me?" while offering her a "special drink" like a Shirley Temple, these seemingly kind gestures highlight Carole's feeling of being " bothered ". These actions, though perhaps well-intentioned, make Carole an object of curiosity or pity, underscoring the racial prejudice that shapes her identity and isolates her from a sense of belonging. This focus on individual interaction reveals how racism is not always overt hatred, but can also be a subtle, daily experience that chips away at a person's sense of self. 

Hill's background provides critical context for understanding his purpose. As the son of a black father and a white mother, both of whom were civil rights activists, he grew up in a household deeply engaged in social justice issues. His experiences traveling and working in Africa also helped him navigate his mixed-race identity and challenged his preconceived notions about what it meant to be black. This personal history is a direct influence on his writing, which consistently explores themes of race, identity, and belonging. His most famous work,  

The Book of Negroes is a historical novel that sheds light on ongoing issues of race and identity by using the real-life ledger of Black Loyalists who escaped to Canada. Through this and other works, Hill urges readers to recognize the historical roots of racism and the personal toll it takes on individuals, serving as a call for empathy and understanding. 

In conclusion, Lawrence Hill's "So, What are You, Anyway?" is an impactful story that leverages personal experience to illuminate the complexities of racial identity. Drawing on my existing knowledge of the time, I found the story's unusual nature to be thought-provoking rather than bothersome. Hill's use of character interactions and his own personal background allowed him to create a powerful commentary on how prejudice shapes a person's sense of self. If more people were to read this story, it would hopefully encourage them to reexamine their values and confront any prejudices they may hold. The story, and Hill's work, underscores a simple yet vital truth: racism is never acceptable, and it must be addressed and eliminated.
