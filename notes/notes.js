                        <li>**Industrial Expansion:** Driven by railroads, steel (Carnegie), and oil (Rockefeller). Marked by massive wealth accumulation and sharp economic inequality.</li>
                        <li>**Urbanization & Immigration:** Cities swelled, leading to tenement housing, public health crises, and the rise of political machines (like Tammany Hall).</li>
                        <li>**Political Corruption:** The period's name, coined by Mark Twain, refers to the superficial glitter hiding deep political graft and corporate influence on government.</li>
                        <li>**Social Response:** Early labor movements (Knights of Labor, AFL) and reform efforts emerged to combat exploitation.</li>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                        <li>**Karl Marx (Conflict Theory):** Class is solely determined by **economic relations** (ownership of the means of production, or *bourgeoisie* vs. *proletariat*). Stratification is inherently exploitative.</li>
                        <li>**Max Weber (Multidimensional View):** Stratification is based on three dimensions: **Class** (economic position), **Status** (social prestige/honor), and **Party** (political power/influence). This offers a more nuanced view than Marx's purely economic focus.</li>
                        <li>**Relevance:** Weber's model better explains modern stratification where factors like education and job prestige (status) often override simple wealth (class).</li>

                    <p>The transition period (c. 133 BCE to 27 BCE) was characterized by military expansion overwhelming Republican political institutions. Key internal crises included:</p>

                        <li>**Rise of Personal Armies:** Generals (Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Caesar) commanded loyal armies, shifting power away from the Senate.</li>
                        <li>**Land Reform Conflicts:** Attempts by the Gracchi brothers to redistribute land led to violence and civil strife.</li>

                        <li>**Sociocultural Context:** Learning is a social process. Language and cultural tools (like calculators, writing systems) are central to cognitive development.</li>
                        <li>**Implication for UDL:** Requires teachers to structure tasks (scaffolding) and provide multiple means of engagement (MKO interactions) to meet students in their ZPD.</li>

                    <p>Feudalism was a decentralized socio-political system in medieval Europe (9thâ€“15th centuries) where land was exchanged for military service and loyalty. It established a rigid hierarchy:</p>

                        <li>**Qualitative:** Focuses on rich, detailed description, context, and meaning. **Goal:** Explore depth, discover meaning, and understand context (e.g., in-depth interviews, ethnography, focus groups).</li>
                        <li>**Mixed Methods:** Increasingly common approach that combines both methods to leverage the strengths of each.</li>
